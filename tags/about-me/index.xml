      <description>Hello and welcome! I&amp;rsquo;m a Bay Area native and Sr. Cloud Security Engineer at CBS Interactive. I&amp;rsquo;m currently pursuing my Master&amp;rsquo;s in Software Engineering (Cybersecurity Concentration) with San Jose State University and enjoying its relevance with my career trajectory!
This blog will be a platform to share my passion and knowledge in Cybersecurity. I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on the areas of Cloud Security/Penetration Testing and the coalescence of the two.
I also look forward to documenting my journey with certifications such as: eJPT, eCPPT, OSCP, AWS/GCP certifications and many more!</description>
